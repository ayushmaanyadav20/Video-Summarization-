A) ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of video content across online platforms, CCTV surveillance networks, educational repositories, and entertainment media has made efficient summarization techniques increasingly essential. As videos become longer and more complex, manually analyzing or extracting meaningful segments becomes impractical. This project presents a modern, AI-driven video summarization system that combines Vision Transformers (ViT-B/16) for spatial feature extraction with Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) or Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks for temporal sequence modeling. The proposed system addresses limitations of traditional summarization methods by integrating advanced deep learning techniques that capture both global context within frames and long-range temporal dependencies across sequences.
The summarization pipeline includes frame extraction with temporal stride reduction, spatial encoding using ViT, temporal scoring using Mamba-SSM or BiLSTM fallback, keyframe and peak-activity detection, and generation of a concise summary video using MoviePy. The models assign importance scores to each frame and locate the most semantically relevant segments, generating summaries of approximately 6–10 seconds while preserving narrative flow. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this hybrid architecture provides a meaningful, context-aware summary that effectively captures core events from diverse types of input videos, including animations, sports clips, surveillance footage, and educational lectures.
The resulting system is modular, scalable, and capable of real-time summarization with GPU support. It lays a strong foundation for future extensions in multimodal analysis, interactive front-end tools, and personalized summarization approaches. This project illustrates the significant potential of combining transformer-based spatial processing with efficient temporal modeling to produce high-quality video summaries.
B) INTRODUCTION
1. Background and Motivation
As global digital infrastructure expands, the volume of video data has reached unprecedented levels. Every day, billions of hours of content are recorded, uploaded, and streamed worldwide. This explosion in multimedia data, driven by social media, surveillance systems, online education, entertainment platforms, and professional recordings, presents a major challenge: effective consumption and analysis.
Users often do not have the time or resources to manually browse through long videos, especially when only key moments or high-level information is needed. Industries such as security monitoring, video editing, sports analytics, and digital archiving require automated methods to compress video length while retaining essential information.
Traditional approaches for summarization relied on handcrafted features, shallow machine learning models, or simple keyframe extraction heuristics. However, such methods lack semantic understanding and fail to capture complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of deep learning, particularly transformer architectures, has transformed the field of video understanding.
2. Need for Intelligent Video Summarization
An intelligent summarization system should:
•
Understand spatial content (objects, scenes, interactions).
•
Capture temporal patterns such as motion, event progression, and transitions.
•
Reduce redundant frames.
•
Extract the meaningful segment in a context-aware manner.
•
Produce a natural-flowing shorter video clip.
Manual summarization is subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Automated summarization brings:
•
Efficiency
•
Consistency
•
Scalability
•
Reduction of human workload
3. Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a modern AI-based video summarization system using:
•
Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for spatial feature extraction
•
Mamba-SSM for temporal sequence modeling (preferred model)
•
BiLSTM as a fallback temporal model
•
Frame scoring and activity window extraction
•
MoviePy for assembling the final summary clip
The final system is capable of producing compact summary videos that highlight the most essential activities while maintaining narrative coherence.
C) PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
1. Volume and Complexity of Video Data
Modern videos contain thousands of frames. A 10-minute video at 30 FPS contains:
10 × 60 × 30 = 18,000 frames
Processing or analyzing such a large quantity manually is impractical.
2. Semantic Gap in Traditional Summarization
Old methods analyze raw pixel changes or frame similarities, but ignore:
•
Object interactions
•
Motion semantics
•
Contextual relevance
•
Storytelling structure
Such techniques cannot answer questions like:
•
“Which part of the video contains the main action?”
•
“Where does something significant happen?”
3. Temporal Dependency Challenges
Videos require modeling both short-term and long-term patterns. RNN-based models:
•
Struggle with long-range dependencies
•
Are computationally expensive
•
Often lose information across sequences
4. Need for Domain-Independent Summarization
Existing systems often work only for:
•
Sports
•
Movies
•
Lecture videos
There is a need for general-purpose architecture that works across all domains.
5. Computation-Efficiency Requirements
Real-time summarization demands:
•
Fast GPU-based processing
•
Lightweight temporal models
•
Efficient embedding generation
D) LITERATURE SURVEY
This section reviews prior approaches to video summarization.
1. Keyframe Extraction Methods
Traditional methods selected frames based on:
•
Color histogram differences
•
Edge/texture variation
•
Pixel intensity changes
Limitations:
•
No semantic meaning
•
Fails on complex scenes
•
Produces choppy, poor-quality summaries
2. Clustering-Based Approaches
Methods like k-means or hierarchical clustering grouped visually similar frames.
Limitations:
•
Ignores story flow
•
Not suitable for dynamic video content
•
Sensitive to noise and lighting changes
3. Shot Boundary Detection
Detects transitions between scenes.
Limitations:
•
Does not work well on animation or continuous motion
•
Summaries become too coarse
4. Deep Learning Approaches
CNN-based summarization
Extracts features using convolutional neural networks.
Weakness: CNNs focus only on local features and struggle with global context.
LSTM-based summarization
LSTM networks model temporal dependencies.
Weakness: Gradients degrade in long sequences.
5. Transformer-Based Models
Transformers introduced self-attention mechanisms capable of understanding global relationships.
Advantages:
•
Captures long-range spatial relations
•
Strong representational power
Limitation:
•
Temporal transformers are computationally heavy
6. State-Space Models (SSMs)
Mamba-SSM introduced:
•
Linear sequence processing complexity
•
Scalability for long videos
•
Better temporal memory representation
This makes SSMs highly suitable for video summarization tasks.
7. Summary
Existing works highlight the need for:
•
Strong spatial modeling
•
Efficient long sequence handling
•
Context-aware summarization
The proposed system addresses these gaps.
E) EXISTING SYSTEM ISSUES
Traditional systems exhibit the following core issues:
1. Lack of Deep Semantic Understanding
Older methods rely on low-level cues and cannot interpret:
•

•
Object relations
•
Motion context
2. Poor Performance on Complex Videos
Examples:
•
Sports videos with rapid motion
•
Animated sequences
•
Multi-person interactions
•

3. Inability to Model Long-Term Dependencies
RNN models forget earlier frames and fail on long videos.
4. High Computational Cost
Some transformer-based video models:
•
Require massive GPU memory
•
Run slowly on large videos
5. No Automatic Clip Extraction
Traditional systems identify keyframes but not summary clips.
6. Lack of Generalization
Most solutions are domain-specific.
The proposed architecture solves these limitations via a modern transformer + SSM/BiLSTM pipeline.
